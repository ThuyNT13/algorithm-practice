Write a function for merging overlapping times

Bonus
1. What if we did have an upper bound on the input values? Could we improve our runtime? Would it cost us memory?
2. Could we do this "in-place" on the input array and save some space? What are the pros and cons of doing this in-place?

O(n lg n) time and O(n) space.

if already sorted, O(n) time.
