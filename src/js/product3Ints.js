/*
Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.

Complexity:
time: O(n log n)  with sorting
      O(n) unsorted
space: O(1)

Bonus
1. What if we wanted the highest product of 4 items? hard-code highestProductOf4
2. What if we wanted the highest product of k items? RECURSION
3. If our highest product is really big, it could overflow â†´ . How should we protect against this?
